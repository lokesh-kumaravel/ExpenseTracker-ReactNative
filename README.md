# 💸 Expense Tracker Mobile App

A full-stack mobile application that allows users to track their personal expenses and manage their financial data. The app is built using **React Native** for the mobile frontend, and **Node.js** with **Express.js** for the backend. **MongoDB** is used as the database to store user data and transactions.

## 📱 Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration using email and password.
- **Expense Management**: Add, edit, and delete expenses.
- **Categories**: Categorize expenses (e.g., Food, Rent, Transportation).
- **Real-time Data**: Fetch and display expenses dynamically from the backend.
- **Data Persistence**: All data is saved in a MongoDB database, ensuring persistence across app restarts.
- **Responsive UI**: Designed to be mobile-friendly with a smooth and intuitive user interface.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: 
  - `React Native` for building cross-platform mobile applications.
  - `React Navigation` for navigation between different screens.
  - `Axios` for making HTTP requests to the backend API.

- **Backend**: 
  - `Node.js` with `Express.js` for creating the RESTful API.
  - `MongoDB` for storing user data and expenses.

- **Authentication**: 
  - `JWT (JSON Web Tokens)` for secure user authentication.
